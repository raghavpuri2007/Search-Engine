# IDP Resources
Resources for Intermediate Data Programming @ North Creek High School - P1 & P3

These resources will be available to you for every homework assignment, and at any time you need. They will be in this repository as markdown (`.md`) files. There are folders separating out the files based on general topics.

It will likely be useful for review, assignments, and quiz/exam preparation. 

The current folders are:
- api/ (info on built-in functions/objects and Pandas API)
  - plots/ (more specific info on matplotlib, seaborn, etc.)
- misc/ (other info like flake8, comments, GitHub, etc)
- ml/ (info on machine learning, both code and concepts)

Here is a list of the current files available, along with a description:
- [collections.md](api/collections.md) (a 'cheatsheet' for methods on lists, sets, dictionaries, and tuples)
- [pandas_df.md](api/pandas_df.md) (a guide on various methods on DataFrames in the Pandas library)
- [f-strings.md](api/f-strings.md) (a guide on formatted strings)
- [method_args.md](api/method_args.md) (a guide on `*args` and `**kwargs`)
- [writing_comments.md](misc/writing_comments.md) (a guide for how to write good inline and docstring comments for your methods - **useful for homeworks**)
- [flake8.md](misc/flake8.md) (an explanation on the flake8 extension, and the rules turned off)



Your IDP TAs are working to get you more resources as the year extends. Some of our future plans are:
- Update and expand info on Pandas DataFrames/Series
- Info on Python classes
- API on ML libraries (like sklearn)
- Explanations on Github Repositories
- ... and more!

If you have any suggestions, feel free to let us or Mr. Rukman know.
